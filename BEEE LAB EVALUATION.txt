EXPERIMENT:Design a system for doors at home, such that whenever a door is opened, a light turns on for 1000 ms if it is day & 2000 ms if it is night.
THEORY:

CONCEPT USED;
1. ARDUINO UNO R3 IS USED FOR THE CONNECTIONS AND IS USED TO MAKE IT WORKS FASTER
2. LDR AND ULTRASONIC SENSOR IS USED TO CHECK THE DAYLIGHT AND TO CHECK THE DISTANCE BY CLOSING AND OPENING OF RESPECTIVELY.


LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
1.WHENEVER THE DISTANCE IS LESS THEN 100CM AS MEASURED BY THE ULTRASONIC SENSOR THE LIGHT GOES OF AND IF ITS MORE THAN 100CM THAN THE LIGHT GLOWS.
2.WHENEVER THE DOORS OPEN THE LDR COMES INTO PLAY AND STARTED SENSING THE DAYLIGHT AND THE DURATION OD GLOWING OF LIGHT IS BASED ON THE LDR AS IF ITS DAY THE LIGHT WILL GLOW FOR 1000ms AND IF ITS NIGHT THAN IT GLOWS FOR 2000ms


PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. CONNECTIONS PROBLEM OCCURED MANY TIMES 
2.LED NOT GLOWING IF THE DISTANCE IS MORE THAN 100CM
3.ERROR IN CODE
4.LDR NOT WORKING AS LED GLOWS CONTINOUSLY


PREACAUTIONS:
1.DONT USE WET HANDS
2.MAKE CONNECTION PROPER AND CHECK IT BEFORE ITS USE
3.PREVENT LOSE CONNECTIONS OF WIRES CONNECTED
4.CHECK THE CODE AND COMPILE TO CHECK IF THERE IS ERROR OR NOT


LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1.COME YO KNOW ABT USE OF LDR AND ULTRASONIC SENSOR
2.LEARNED TO WORK WITH ARDUINO UNO R3 ON TINKER CAD
